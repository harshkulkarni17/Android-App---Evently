# Evently
An android application that automates the task of adding the event details from a poster to google calendar.
## What it does
Evently is an android application that does the work of automatically remembering, recording, and notifying the user about the event with just a snap of an image of an event poster. The user just needs to take a picture of the poster and Evently will extract all the necessary information such as Date, Time, Location, Event name from the poster, In addition, It will also add the given event to google calendar which helps to recall. We have added one input field for inviting people to this event, so that if user wants to share that event with others, he can add emails in that field and google calendar will send notifications to invited people.
